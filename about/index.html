<p>I am a Data Scientist üë®‚Äçüî¨ born and trained in the Netherlands and based in Helsinki, Finland. Currently I am working in Ramboll&rsquo;s Digital Mobility Lab, where I develop and apply new digital methods for mobility analytics.</p>

<p>By training I am both a Civil Engineer specialised in transportation science and an Urban Planner trained in the spatial impacts of mobility.</p>

<p>I am fascinated by the dynamics in cities and I consider it my mission to contribute to liveable cities through data science methods.</p>

<p>Both in my professional and academic career I have been developing different simulation models and studies, all with a strong spatial or transportation component. For my master theses, I developed an agent-based model to assess the effects of self-driving cars on cities. During my career in the Netherlands I took part in the development of models that assess the potential for renewable energy sources both in the landscape and in cities. Right now, I am - amongst others - responsible for application and further development of an individual-level travel demand models that is being applied in various different countries.</p>
