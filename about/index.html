<p><em>Understanding Mobility and Cities through Simulation, Data Science and Design Thinking.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I am a Data Scientist with a background in transportation science and urban planning. I am from the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, but currently I am based in Helsinki, Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®.</p>

<p>I have always been interested in the ways human behaviour and interaction shapes our built environment. In my worklife and studies, I have specialised myself in understanding the relation between mobility and cities, using methods from different disciplines.
In recent years, I have increasingly dedicated myself to quantitative methods in the field of simulation and other data science methods. I like to build advanced tools to study the complexity of cities, but also take on a creative, data driven and visual approach to urban planning problems.</p>

<p>Currently I am working as a data scientist in Ramboll&rsquo;s Digital Mobility Lab, where I develop and apply transport simulation models and other new digital methods for mobility analytics.</p>

<p>I am experienced with various programming language and tools, transport modelling solutions and geo-spatial software. However, my most preferend language is <code>R</code>. I also like making clear and attractive visualisation using Adobe CS.</p>

<h3 id="work-experience">Work experience</h3>

<p>2019 - <br />
<strong>Data Scientist, Digital Mobility Lab - Ramboll Finland</strong> <br />
After acquisition by Ramboll, Strafica&rsquo;s Data Science team formed Digital Mobility Lab. Amongst others, I spend a large share of my time on the development and application of Brutus, a state-of-the-art individual-level travel demand model.</p>

<p>2018 - 2019 <br />
<strong>Data Scientist, Strafica</strong> <br />
Strafica was a leading Finnish transport and infrastructure planning consultancy firm. It has been acquired by Ramboll.</p>

<p>2014 - 2018 <br />
<strong>Urban planner and designer, <a href="https://posadmaxwan.nl">PosadMaxwan</a></strong> <br />
Within PosadMaxwan I was involved in various research-by-design projects on the spatial impacts of smart mobility, various planning phases of a large-scale highway redevelopment and more. I furthermore participated in the development of two different models that determine the potential of reneweable energy both in the landscape and in the built environment.</p>
